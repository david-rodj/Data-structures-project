# Data Structures Project

This repository contains a project developed for a Data Structures course, implementing various data structures and algorithms in C++.

## Overview

The project includes implementations of several fundamental data structures and algorithms, such as graphs and trees. These implementations serve as a practical demonstration of concepts learned during the course.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `main.cpp`: The main entry point of the application.
- `Grafo.h` and `Grafo.cxx`: Header and source files for the Graph class, which represents a graph and includes methods for graph operations.
- `Vertice.h` and `Vertice.cxx`: Header and source files for the Vertex class, representing a vertex in the graph.
- `Arista.h` and `Arista.cxx`: Header and source files for the Edge class, representing an edge connecting two vertices.
- `Cara.h` and `Cara.cxx`: Header and source files for the Face class, representing a face in the graph.
- `Objeto.h` and `Objeto.cxx`: Header and source files for the Object class, representing an object associated with the graph.
- `Sistema.h` and `Sistema.cxx`: Header and source files for the System class, managing overall system operations.
- `ejemplo1.txt`, `ejemplo2.txt`, `ejemplo3.txt`, `ejemplo4.txt`: Text files containing example data used for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Compilation Guide

To compile and run the project, follow these steps:
